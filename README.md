## How to Play and Game Rules

1. **Start the Game**: Open the game in your web browser by navigating to the `index.html` file.
2. **Gameplay**: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid. The two players take turns clicking on a cell to place their symbol (X or O).
3. **Turn-Based Play**: Players take turns placing their respective symbols. The first player is "X", and the second player is "O". A player cannot put their symbol in an already occupied cell.
4. **Objective**: The goal is to get three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal. The first player to achieve this wins the game.
5. **Winning the Game**: A player wins by placing their symbol in three consecutive cells horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
6. **Draw Condition**: If all the cells in the grid are filled without either player getting three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.
7. **Reset**: After each game, you can reset the board by clicking the "Reset" button to start a new game.

### Additional Rules:
- **Grid Size**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, making a total of 9 cells to choose from.
- **Game Reset**: The game can be restarted at any time by clicking the "Reset" button, which clears the board and starts a new round.
